		<h1>Welcome to Honda Connect Personalization</h1>
		<p>Concept By Team Nomad</p>
	</div>

	<div class="marq">
		<marquee>This is a Proof of Concept for the Honda Hackathon Voice Assistant Personalization to Enhance User Experience</marquee>
	</div>

	<div class="intro">
		<h3>Introduction to the Personalization Features: </h3>
		<p>
			<b>1. What is the Significance of Personalization?</b>	<br>
			For an AI Assistant to be Relevant and to be part of a User's Life, it is necessary for the User to get access to certain personalization features in order to stay relevant to the Real-Time Application. Technology should not distract the User from driving and staying attentive at all times. The user needs operational control over the voice assistance in order to enhance the User Experience. Hence there is a need for Personalization of Voice based Assistant Features.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>2. How do we Aim to Achieve it?</b> <br>
			Personalization can be achieved from basic attributes such as set of enabling/disabling options to having Alexa Home interface learn your routine and perform relative tasks accordingly. In this POC, The <a class="preference" href="#preferences">Preferences</a> option in the Navigation Bar above takes the User to a set of configuration pins. This enables the user to select and deselect preferred options in order to have optimal experience with the voice assistant.  <br>
			<b>Note:</b>b> Personalization is an on-car and off-car voice based user experience concept.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>3. What is Configure Journey?</b> <br>
			A User can now setup a Journey based Alert System. If a User travels to Work from his/her House in the Morning at 8:30 from Monday to Friday, The user can configure the same into the application. This configuration lets the user know in advance regarding the traffic situation, the optimal route and the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) in real time. This simple feature can make the User's life 10 times easier and will ensure a constant interaction with the AI Assistant for the most part. <br>
			<b>Note:</b>b> Configure Journey is an on-car voice based user experience concept. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>4. What is Diagnosis?</b> <br>
			With the help of the existing on-board sensors that helps the application to perform security check on the Honda car with regards to detecting Engine status, Windows and Lock check, Light status and so on, the On-Board Computer (OBC) is given an additional firmware update that logs certain aspects of the Engine and other relevant data. The Logged data is then passed through a program (Refer ReadMe in Phase Submission Folder) that performs Linear Regression Algorithm. This Algorithm generates an equation that potentially can estimate the condition of the Engine. As per user preference, the Assistant can either Prompt a user for a future servicing appointment or automate the whole appointment procedure with notification enabled to the user. <br>
			<b>Note:</b> Diagnosis is an off-car voice based user experience concept.
